 # Raspberry Pi set up 
The initial set up for the raspberry pi was pretty much the same as the medium article and I also used the official raspberry pi docs to help out.
I used a usb mouse and moniter to set up and VNC viewer to setup the headless raspberry pi. There were some minor changes from the medium article but was pretty easy to figure things out.<br>

# Building the car
The car for the project was the same as the article, a SunFounde PiCar-V 2.0.<br>

Completing the construction of the car took me longer than expected. I sucked dealing with the small screws and kept on dropping them on my carpet. This meant I spent 5 -  10 minutes finding them each time I dropped them. 

The instructions for the camera mount were also not as detailed as the initial build, so I had to find additional resources to finish the construction.
